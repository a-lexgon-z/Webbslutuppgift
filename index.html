        <h1>Grand italian</h1>
        <p class="home">5/5 Michelin stars</p>

        <h2>"Best Italian Restaurant"</h2>
        
        <p>Consistently packed since its 1985 opening, Grand Italian is best known for its outdoor seating </p>
      
        <p>area, which spills onto the sidewalk along Sixth Avenue. It's an easy place to spot actors,</p>
      
        <p>models, rock stars, and socialites, but the food is great, too—come for a strong offering of </p>

        <p>classics executed really well, with one of the city’s best Caprese salads. It’s the perfect place to </p>

        <p>take out of town guests for an "only in New York" type of experience, where they'll see a full</p>

        <p>cross-section of downtown denizens and get a great meal, to boot.</p>
        
        <h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
        
        <p>"Lunch today was truly wonderful. The room is beautiful and calm. The service was perfection and the food was wonderful. This will be our 12th Michelin 5 Star experience and it did not disappoint. I have to say, this is a special treat. If you are up for it, do the carte Blanche menu, its all chef surprises and it was truly special."</p>
        
        <p>"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. The staff provided by the service was excellent. Big thank you to Jean Klaus who made it a memorable evening. The food was simply divine and the chestnut linguine with black truffle is so worth paying extra for. "</p>
